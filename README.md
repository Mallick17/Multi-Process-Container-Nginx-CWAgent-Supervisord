# Dockerized solution for running NGINX and the AWS CloudWatch Agent on Amazon Linux 2 using Supervisord.
# Why are we using this approach 
Using **Supervisord** to manage NGINX and the AWS CloudWatch agent in a single Docker container was chosen for its simplicity and reliability in handling multiple processes. Below, I’ll explain why Supervisord was used, why it works well for this scenario, and why other approaches were considered more complicated. I’ll also provide context for the provided Docker setup and address the specific needs of your trial test (running NGINX and CloudWatch agent in a single `amazonlinux:2`-based container to push NGINX access logs and disk metrics to CloudWatch).

### Why Supervisord Was Used
Docker containers are designed to run a single foreground process by default. When you need to run multiple processes (e.g., NGINX and the CloudWatch agent) in a single container, you need a process manager to start, monitor, and keep both processes running. Supervisord was chosen for the following reasons:

1. **Simple Process Management**:
   - Supervisord is a lightweight process control system that can start, stop, and monitor multiple processes, ensuring they run concurrently and restart if they fail.
   - It allows you to define NGINX and the CloudWatch agent as separate programs in a single configuration file (`supervisord.conf`), making it easy to manage both in one container.

2. **Foreground Process Requirement**:
   - Docker requires the container’s entrypoint to run in the foreground to keep the container alive. Supervisord runs as the foreground process (`nodaemon=true`) and manages NGINX and the CloudWatch agent in the background, satisfying this requirement.
   - Without a process manager, you’d need complex scripting to keep both processes running and ensure the container doesn’t exit.

3. **Ease of Configuration**:
   - Supervisord uses a simple INI-style configuration file (`supervisord.conf`) to define how to run NGINX (`nginx -g 'daemon off;'`) and the CloudWatch agent (`start-amazon-cloudwatch-agent`).
   - It redirects logs to `/dev/stdout` and `/dev/stderr`, making them accessible via `docker logs`, which simplifies debugging.

4. **Compatibility with `amazonlinux:2`**:
   - Supervisord is easily installed via `pip3 install supervisor` on `amazonlinux:2`, requiring minimal setup compared to other process managers.
   - It integrates seamlessly with the Docker environment and the CloudWatch agent.

5. **Reliability**:
   - Supervisord automatically restarts processes if they crash (`autorestart=true`), ensuring NGINX and the CloudWatch agent remain operational.
   - It handles process dependencies and logging, reducing the risk of one process failing and causing the container to exit.
